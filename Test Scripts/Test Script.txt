1. play() : The play() method of TwoPlayers.java class is a significant part of the program. Without this method, the game is no going to work. Thus, the proper running of this method is most important. This method, when called, reads the handOne and handTwo ArrayLists, and then prints the last cards from both the ArrayLists, then this method puts those cards into a dump and then uses if...else statements to decide which player gets the dump. Once the decision has been made and dump is given to a player, the method asks the players if the want to continue with the game or if they want to end the game right away. The user makes their choice and the method calls appropriate method to declare the winner. 
To test that the program runs as expected, we tried to draw more than one card at a time but it wasn't letting us do that. Thus the method passes its first test.
Then we tweeked the ArrayLists: handOne and handTwo, and entered the same card in the last place of both the ArrayLists. The method didn't throw an error, instead it did what it was expected to do,i.e., leave the dump as is and move to next round. 

2. main() : The main() method of Main.java class is responsible for the execution of the program and taking input of player names. The input names must be of String data type. Thus to test this method, we tried to give String inputs, non-string inputs and mixed-inputs, the results were as expected,i.e., no matter what the user enters as player name, the method should not throw an error, instead it should take the input and make it the playerID for the game.
